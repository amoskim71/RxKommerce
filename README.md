# RxKommerce
E-commerce app with multiple stores using RxAndroid, Retrofit and Kotlin 1.1.4

To make the app works with your own WS put your server address in the Constants class' constant URL and change the endpoints in the GetWaterApiServices class.

And, of course, don't forget to improve the app's layout. This one was made only for study purpose.

Be happy (:
